# Average-execution-time-of-cryptographic-operations
This code estimates the execution time of operations such as pairing and exponentiation using Charm. Charm is a popular framework for rapidly prototyping advanced cryptosystems. Our code supports all the available curves in the Charm library. 
To use this code, the following steps must be performed:

1- Installing Charm and its dependencies(like Python, GMP, PBC,...). See more information in https://jhuisi.github.io/charm/install_source.html.

2- Running execution-time.py.
