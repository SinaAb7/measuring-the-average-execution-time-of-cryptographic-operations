# Average-execution-time-of-cryptographic-operations
This code estimates execution time of operations such as pairing and exponentiation using charm framework. Our code supports all the available curves in the charm library. 
To use this code, the following steps must be performed:
1- Installing charm and its dependencies(like Python, GMP, PBC,...). See the charm page(https://jhuisi.github.io/charm/install_source.html).
2- Running Execution-time.py file.
